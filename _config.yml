 “As a painter, I make digital collages to build large-scale pictures; temporal and spatial constructs that offer the viewer different levels of understanding, experience and perception. I often talk about building and composing as two different paths and gestures, to merge them while working. When building is about becoming, composing is about correspondences, but both are about an equilibrium, an instable station, and a pictorial need, a necessity to create a perceptible event. Trained in theatre and film, my relation to time, space, desire and reality, to unstructured cosmos and organisable chaos, are influenced by theatricality and cinema, and their modes of development, and or composition. I love to analyze brain’s structure, body’s function or fictional mythology as holograms, mental artifacts: dynamic projections struggling from silence to busyness from busyness to silence, and I constantly work to merge the fictional and the real into a third reality: the tableau as a process. Its completion as a particular step becomes a goal, which lead the work within a whole strategy, where production is not only about to assemble but also about to relate and or to question and response to different poetical and political obsessions. I understand the real as a vast matrix, I treat space as a multi-dimensional organization of semantic units that I multiply, subtract and arrange together in regard the process. My works are organic, gestural responses to the ubiquity of digital mediation, through narrative and abstract representation. It portrays a reality of functional configurations, figurative scenes or abstract landscapes, which echo structures and situations from the real world, within my pictorial action and intimate needs, painting understood as a metaphorical translation, from the world to the world. In that way, I engage both my palette and the extension of spatiality on their own terms, confronting my medium with each subjects as a set of questions, practically answered through the production of individual paintings, series, or generic concepts.”   Pierre Emmanuel Fillet is a French painter, poet, actor and filmmaker, born in Lyon in 1980. He has been painting in the digital medium since the age of 18. Fillet studied film and acting at the National Theatre School in Brittany, from 1999 to 2002 in France, and began making films during his travels across China in 2004. In addition to painting and filmmaking, he directed and staged different theatrical projects in France before moving to New York
